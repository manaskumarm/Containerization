# Docker
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

## Multistage
A Docker multi-stage build allows you to use multiple _FROM_ statements in your Dockerfile. Each _FROM_ statement represents a distinct stage in the build process. This technique helps optimize Docker images for size, security, and build speed.

**Multiple Stages**:
Each FROM instruction starts a new stage, creating a separate image.
You can name each stage using the AS keyword for easier reference.

**Selective Copying**:
Use the COPY --from instruction to selectively copy files and directories between stages.
This approach brings in only the necessary artifacts from previous stages, reducing the final image size.

```
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:16 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Create the production image
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
EXPOSE 8082
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```
### Advantages
**Smaller Image Size**: When you use different stages for building and running an application, you can exclude unnecessary dependencies and intermediate files from the final image. This results in a smaller image, which makes it faster to download and deploy.

**Improved Security**: Multi-stage builds allow you to minimize the attack surface by including only the essential components in the final image. By doing so, you reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and exploits.

**Faster Builds**: Organizing the build process into stages enables you to leverage Dockerâ€™s layer caching mechanism more efficiently. If you make changes to your code, only the affected stages need to be rebuilt, saving time during development.
