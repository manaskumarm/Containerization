Open Powershell in Administrator mode:

minikube dashboard

Setup:
	First a user needs to be invited from CarrierAppsHub from a Group. Then user click on CArrierSSO, provide system credentials and enter into system. Please find the attached document how to browse applications. 
	
Feature(Soft delete users):
	We usually invite users from a group. A user can be mapped to multiple groups. If a user belongs to only one group and Admin removes the user from a group. 


We can use Kubernetes in local 2 ways. First, we can install minikube manually and start the cluster, secondly with docker. Enable kubernetes in Docker desktop. 
If you have already installed kubectl and it is pointing to some other environment, such as minikube or a GKE cluster, ensure you change the context so that kubectl is pointing to docker-desktop:

>kubectl config get-contexts
>kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
 
To see Kubernetes dashbaord
> kubectl proxy
